## 🚀 About the Lab

The **[Engineering Space Policy Laboratory (ESPL)](https://espl.ae.gatech.edu/)** at Georgia Tech is an interdisciplinary research group dedicated to engineering a more **coordinated**, **sustainable**, and **secure** outer space domain.

Housed jointly in the **[Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering](https://ae.gatech.edu/)** and the **[Sam Nunn School of International Affairs](https://inta.gatech.edu/)**, ESPL researchers study how space actors — from start-ups to superpowers — behave in an increasingly congested space environment.

As a **policy-impact laboratory**, ESPL develops research products that inform space mission decision-making at the operator, state, and international levels.

Led by **Prof. Thomas González Roberts**, ESPL complements Georgia Tech's world-class programming in both space systems engineering and outer space affairs as it prepares students to become leaders across the international space community.

## 🔭 Research Areas

ESPL's research spans the intersection of engineering, policy, and international relations in the space domain. Key focus areas include:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🛰️ **Space Situational Awareness** | Studying how operators track and characterize objects in orbit to support safe and sustainable spaceflight |
| 🌐 **Space Governance & Policy** | Analyzing international frameworks, norms, and treaties that shape behavior in outer space |
| 🔒 **Space Security** | Examining how states and commercial actors respond to threats in the space domain |
| ♻️ **Orbital Sustainability** | Investigating debris mitigation, traffic management, and long-term stewardship of orbital regimes |
| 🤝 **Norms & Standards** | Developing actionable guidelines for responsible behavior by space actors at all levels |
